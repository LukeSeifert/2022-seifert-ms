This appendix serves as a supplement to the discussion in Section \ref{s:batch-sum}.
Here, I show the steady state mass of some arbitrary nuclide which is processed using Steady batchwise reprocessing.

The first step of this derivation is to separate the $\lambda$ term into the continuous $\lambda_c$, which is the continuous losses in the Bateman equation, and the batchwise reprocessing $\lambda_r$.
This is given by:

\begin{equation} \hfill
\lambda = \lambda_c + \lambda_r.
\hfill \end{equation}

Next, set up and solve the differential equation for the continuous portions of the process.
This is set as the rate of change of the mass over time is equivalent to the constant rate of gain, $C$, minus the continuous losses.
This is given by:

\begin{equation} \hfill
\frac{dm}{dt} = C - \lambda_c m,
\hfill \end{equation}

where

\begin{equation} \hfill
m(t) = \left(m_0 - \frac{C}{\lambda_c} \right) e^{-\lambda_c t}  + \frac{C}{\lambda_c}.
\hfill \end{equation}

Then, I modify the continuous equation to a process which updates at discrete time steps:

\begin{equation} \hfill
m_{n+1} = \left(m_n - \frac{C}{\lambda_c} \right) e^{-\lambda_c \Delta t}  + \frac{C}{\lambda_c}.
\hfill \end{equation}

After each new discrete time step, I apply the batchwise reprocessing. 
Each time step is evaluated as a depletion time step.
This is given by:

\begin{equation} \hfill
m_{n+1} = \left(\left(m_n - \frac{C}{\lambda_c} \right) e^{-\lambda_c \Delta t}  + \frac{C}{\lambda_c}\right) \left(1 - {\lambda_r \Delta t} \right).
\hfill \label{eq:nplusone}\end{equation}

From here, I define some arbitrary variables for ease of use:

\begin{equation} \hfill
\alpha = \frac{C}{\lambda_c},
\hfill \end{equation}

\begin{equation} \hfill
\epsilon = e^{-\lambda_c \Delta t},
\hfill \end{equation}

\begin{equation} \hfill
\gamma = \left(1 - {\lambda_r \Delta t} \right).
\hfill \end{equation}

Using these in Equation \eqref{eq:nplusone}, the mass can be calculated for several subsequent steps.
The more compact form of Equation \eqref{eq:nplusone} is given by:

\begin{equation} \hfill
m_{n+1} = \left(\left(m_n - \alpha \right) \epsilon  + \alpha\right) \gamma.
\hfill \label{eq:one} \end{equation}

The initial condition is defined as:

\begin{equation} \hfill
m_0 = m_0.
\hfill \label{eq:two} \end{equation}

Combining Equations \eqref{eq:one} and \eqref{eq:two}, the first step is given by:

\begin{equation} \hfill
m_1 = m_0 \epsilon \gamma - \alpha \epsilon \gamma + \alpha \gamma,
\hfill \end{equation}

and the second step is given by:

\begin{equation} \hfill
m_2 = m_0 \epsilon^2 \gamma^2 - \alpha \epsilon^2 \gamma^2 + \alpha \epsilon \gamma^2 - \alpha \epsilon \gamma + \alpha \gamma.
\hfill \end{equation}

Finally, the n$^{th}$ step mass can be derived by following the pattern shown in the previous equations.
This is given by:

\begin{equation} \hfill
m_n = m_0 \epsilon^n \gamma^n + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^n \gamma^j (\epsilon^{j-1} - \epsilon^j).
\hfill \end{equation}

As the time approaches infinity, the steady state mass will be reached.
Because this is an iterative process, this means $n$ will be set to approach infinity as well to reach steady state.
%Moving towards the goal of the steady state mass, the value of $n$ is taken to be approaching infinity.
Because the values of $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ are both between zero and one, simplifications can be made.
This is given by:

\begin{equation} \hfill
m_{ss} = m_0 \epsilon^{\infty} \gamma^{\infty} + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \gamma^j (\epsilon^{j-1} - \epsilon^j),
\hfill \end{equation}

which simplifies to:
 
\begin{equation} \hfill
m_{ss} = \alpha \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \gamma^j (\epsilon^{j-1} - \epsilon^j).
\hfill \end{equation}

The next step is to simplify the summation term by changing $\epsilon$ back to its original form.
This is given by:

\begin{equation} \hfill
m_{ss} = \alpha \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \gamma^j (e^{-\lambda_c \Delta t (j-1)} - e^{-\lambda_c \Delta t j}).
\hfill \end{equation}

Next, I group the exponential terms together that have $j$ in the exponent, given by:

\begin{equation} \hfill
m_{ss} = \alpha \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \gamma^j e^{-\lambda_c \Delta t j} (e^{\lambda_c \Delta t} - 1).
\hfill \end{equation}

The terms which multiply but do not contain $j$ from the summation can be pulled outside of the summation, given by:

\begin{equation} \hfill
m_{ss} = \alpha (e^{\lambda_c \Delta t} - 1) \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \gamma^j e^{-\lambda_c \Delta t j}.
\hfill \end{equation}

Next, the geometric series can be solved by using the following equation from \cite{Mathematica}:

\begin{equation} \hfill
\sum_{j=1}^{\infty} x^j = \frac{x}{1-x} \ni |x| < 1
\hfill \end{equation}

This yields the equation for the steady state mass:

\begin{equation} \hfill
m_{ss} = \alpha (e^{\lambda_c \Delta t} - 1) \frac{\gamma^j e^{-\lambda_c \Delta t j}}{1 - \gamma^j e^{-\lambda_c \Delta t j}}.
\hfill \end{equation}

Plugging in the variables $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ yields the full equation for the steady state mass with batchwise reprocessing:

\begin{equation} \hfill 
m_{ss} =  \frac{C}{\lambda - \lambda_r} \left(e^{(\lambda - \lambda_r) \Delta t} - 1 \right) \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \left(1 - \lambda_r \Delta t \right) e^{-(\lambda - \lambda_r) \Delta t} \right)^n.
\hfill \end{equation}
